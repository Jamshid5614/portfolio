                        InVision Studio is a new powerful 
                        tool where you can design, prototype 
                        and animate your projects easily. One 
                        of InVision's initiatives is the Design 
                        Forward Fund, a $5 million fund dedicated 
                        to investing in the future of design. I'm 
                        happy to say that my idea was among several 
                        selected for implementation and shortly after 
                        the initial 
                        interviews, we began shaping requirements for the Basic UX project.

                        Our goal was to create an 
                        extensive library of components and assets to help designers wireframe 
                        their web projects faster. Over the course of 5 months I designed more 
                        than 400 layout components in 30 categories (each prepared for desktop, 
                        tablet & phone screens), 128 icons, 56 user journey map elements and over 
                        100 user interface elements. You can 
                        easily customize and combine them when working on your wireframes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Aside from that, I was in touch with the Director of Product and the 
                        InVision tech team to report issues and bugs that I found within the software, 
                        as well as to propose improvements regarding certain functionalities. It was 
                        exciting to see how the 
                        product evolved and improved with each update during this short time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final deliverable was a family of 4 
                        products that you can download and use for 
                        free. Just download InVision Studio, open their 
                        App Store and search for 128 Outline Icons, eCommerce 
                        Wireframe Kit, User Interface Kit and Web Wireframe Kit.

            <p>CLIENT TESTIMONIAL</p>
            <p>
                I would definitely recommend working with Damian. 
                His work was well-done and very well thought out. 
                The final product had great breadth and was-well 
                organized. We are excited to launch his work so that 
                users can get started with his kits, eliminating friction. 
                From a process perspective Damian went above and beyond to 
                provide detailed timing updates, as well as invaluable feedback 
                for us. We really appreciated his communication during the project!
