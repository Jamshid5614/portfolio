                        Less Doing, More Living was a conference about productivity and entrepreneurship hosted by Ari Meisel, author of two bestselling books: “The Art of Less Doing” and “The Replaceable Founder”. The event lasted for three days and took place in the Scholastic Building in the heart of Manhattan, New York.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides Ari Meisel, several other speakers gave their valuable insights regarding productivity and entrepreneurship: Joe Polish, Dean Jackson, Dave Asprey, Ben Greenfield and Jordan Harbinger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the design perspective, the goal was to create an elegant, simple and engaging website focused on selling the conference tickets; the website was meant to have a checkout form and provide information about the event, the speakers, schedule, and venue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the course of approximately four weeks I designed all of the pages and then worked closely with the development team to make sure that its final form looked as intended. The scope of work included creating an extensive set of Facebook ads in order to promote the conference on social media. We were extremely happy that the project succeeded and the tickets were sold out.

            <p>CLIENT TESTIMONIAL</p>
            <p>
                Damian is the most talented designer I have ever worked with. He created a sales page and a design for an event in New York City, called Less Doing, More Living. From start to finish, Damian’s designs of Facebook ads, sales pages, and emails produced a sold-out event. I can credit his excellent design with our ability to produce such results for our clients. If you need a top designer who works quickly with minimal supervision, don't hesitate to hire Damian.
