                        Triniso is a Swiss watch manufacturer of luxurious and affordable watches in the Sierre, a beautiful vineyard region in the south of Switzerland. As they were launching a new watch series, they needed a new website that would tell their incredible story, and an intuitive shopping experience to showcase their products and make the purchase process easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I collaborated with cloudtec AG on this project. Our brief was to design a minimalist and elegant responsive website that would help the company to distribute content and reflect their interesting history & roots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had a lot of creative freedom during the design process; the main challenge however was that the photo session for watches and other sections of the website would take place after the design was done, so I had to come up with solutions that would be easy to adapt to any new images. The plan was to use the Sylius framework for the cart and the checkout process, so my decisions had to be easily integrated with the existing system, while still maintaining the overall look and feel of the rest of the website.

            <p>
                We had poor graphics and very little content and structure for this project, but Damian helped us to design an outstanding online shop by creating amazingness out of nothing. The bespoke design for Desktops, Tablets and Smartphones was delivered in such a way that our developers were able to convert it into HTML/CSS in no time. When you work with Damian you work with a professional designer who understands the limitations and implications between design and code.
